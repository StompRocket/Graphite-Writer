  	<h1>About Us</h1>
  	<p>Graphite Writer is a project by Ronan and Sasha S. We created Graphite Writer because we saw a problem; other web-based text editors took ages to load. In response we decided to make Graphite Writer. Our goals were to make a simple, secure, and fast web-based text editor for free.
